# Liri Node App

## Overview:
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI; however, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 
This is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
## How to run the app:
Make sure to first install the necessary packages using NPM. Then, in the terminal type in one of the following commands (ex: `node liri.js concert-this madonna`), and the app should return information about that concert, song, or movie:
* `concert-this` + band or singer name
* `spotify-this-song` + song name
* `movie-this` + movie name
* `do-what-it-says` (reads what's in the random.txt file and runs that command)
## Technologies Used:
Javascript, Node.js, NPM, Axios, Moment.js
